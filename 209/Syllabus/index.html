</div>-->

<h3><a name="Structure">Course Structure</a></h3>
<div class="section">
  The class will be divided into two sections:
  <p>The first hour will be devoted to <b>computer programming
  assignments</b> using VPython.  Students will work in pairs or
  individually for this portion.
  <ul>
    <li>The programming assignment will be available at the beginning
    of class.
    <li>The instructor may begin with an introduction.  There may be
    tutorial videos which the whole class will watch together with
    discussion, or students might be asked to watch them independently.
    <li>Students will work through the assignment while the instructor
    walks around and assists.
    <li>If requested, one student from each pair will email their completed programs as plaintext to
    shill@adrian.edu with the Subject line "209 Assignment" followed
    by the number of the assignment and the name of the student's
    partner (if any).
  </ul>
  The next two hours will be devoted to <b>experiment</b>.  Students
  will work in groups of 3 or 2 for this portion.
  <ul>
<li>At the end of the first hour or when everyone is done programming
    (whichever comes first), the instructor will pause to explain how to set up the
    experiment, and the underlying physics.
    <li>Lab groups will then get out the equipment and work through
    the experiment, recording the results in their notebook.
    <li>The instructor will be available to answer questions and check
    on your progress.
    <li>At the end of class, each student will submit their own lab report
    including data, sample calculations, graphs (perhaps printed from
    the computer), and answers to questions posed in the assignment.
    Although students will work together to collect data and generate
    graphs, they will prepare their own individual lab reports,
    writing out answers in their own words, etc.
    <li>With the instructor's permission, the group will submit their
    lab reports, put their equipment away, and leave.
  </ul>
  
</div>

<h3><a name="Grading">Grading</a></h3>
<div class="section">
  Each programming assignment and each lab will be worth 10 points
  each; your grade for the course will be the average of these
  grades.  You may miss one lab without penalty; if you need to miss
  additional labs due to an activity, illness, etc, please contact the
  instructor to make arrangements about making up the work.
</div>

<!--<h3 class="ongoing"><a name="Excuses">Excused Absences</a></h3>
<div class="section">
  Typically, a quiz that isn't completed in time will
  receive a zero (possibly counting as one of the "dropped"
  assignments for each category).  The exception is when you miss
  class due to an <i>excused absence</i>.
  <h4>How can I qualify for an excused absence?</h4>
  <ol>
    <li>Have a good reason for your absence.
    <li>Contact me <b>before the missed class begins</b>, unless
    this is demonstrably impossible.  Contact should be via written
    note, email, telephone, SMS, IM, etc.  Simply telling me during
    class is not sufficient, because I will forget.  You are
    responsible for failed communication (wrong number, lost email,
    etc).  The sooner you let me know, the better.
    <li>Within a week after returning to class, you must provide the
    instructor with some sort of documentation for your absence: a
    doctor's note, an athletic calendar, etc.  If you're not sure what
    qualifies as documentation, we will work something out.
  </ol>
  <h4>What qualifies as a "good" reason?</h4>
  They generally fall into one of four categories:
  <ul>
    <li><b>personal emergencies</b> (illness, death in the family, etc).
    <li><b>religious observances</b> that prevent the student from attending
    class
    <li><b>government-mandated activities</b>, such as jury duty or military
    service
    <li><b>college-sponsored activities</b> (including athletics); note that
    rehearsals and practices do <i>not</i> generally count as excused
    absences according to college policy.  If you have your schedule
    of games or performances (etc), please send it to me before the
    end of the first week of class.
  </ul>
<p>  If you're not sure if something counts, please don't hesitate to ask
  me.</p>
  <h4>What happens if I get an excused absence?</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>For <b>quizzes</b>, it will be as if that quiz never existed
    for you.  It will <i>not</i> count as one of your dropped
    quizzes.  I do not give makeup quizzes because the quiz solutions
    are posted almost immediately after class.  (An exception may be
    made if a large number of quizzes are missed, at my discretion.)
    <li>For <b>exams</b>, we will schedule a makeup exam in my office
    as soon as possible.  This will either be in written or oral form,
    at my discretion.
  </ul>
  <h4>What if I'm late to a quiz or exam?</h4>
  Come anyway!  It's a lot easier to give you a little extra time,
  than to find a whole extra hour to squeeze you in.
  <h4>Do I have to let you know if I'm going to miss a class and there's no quiz or exam that day?</h4>
  No; attendance is not required.  I trust you to choose your own
  priorities.
  <h4>You didn't mention homework!</h4>
  Because homework is done online, the only absences that will matter
  are those that involve an extended illness or activity.  Please
  consult me in such a case.  The homework system is set up to accept
  late homework with a 20% penalty per day late.  Just because the
  homework is <i>due</i> on Saturday morning doesn't mean you should
  wait until Saturday morning to do it, particularly if you plan to be
  up late Friday night.

<!--<h2 style="font-weight:900;font-size:200%"><a name="Policies">Policies</a></h2>-->
<h3>Academic Accommodations</h3>
<div class="section permanent">
<p>If you have a disability, which may affect your performance in class, 
let me know as soon as possible.  Students with disabilities must 
self-advocate.  You will need to provide recent, appropriate 
documentation, which verifies the need for reasonable academic 
accommodation.  A copy of all documents is retained by Danielle Ward in 
the Office of Academic Services (Jones Hall).  Email Danielle at 
dward@adrian.edu or ask for her in Academic Services. (Statement used 
with permission)</p>
</div>
<!--<h3>Academic Integrity</h3>
<div class="section">
<p>Cheating of any kind is a violation of the college’s Academic
  Integrity Policy (See Student Handbook). For example, if a student
  plagiarizes by copying the work of another person with the intention
  of deceptively representing that work as his or her own, the student
  will receive a zero for that assignment. The Assistant Dean of
  Student Affairs will be informed and it will be noted on the
  student’s permanent record.  A second offense may result in failure
  of the course.</p>
  <p>It is permissible to discuss the online homework assignments with
  other students; however, when you sit down at the website, the work
  you do must be your own.  Exams and quizzes are to be completed with no assistance from
  anyone else.</p>

</div>
-->

<!--
<h3>Technology in the Classroom</h3>
<div class="section">
You are permitted to use laptops, tablets, cellphones, etc (hereafter
  referred to as "tech") during lectures, with the following caveats.
<ul>
  <li>Your tech must not bother anyone else.  Turn off the volume, and
  make sure your screen isn't bothering or distracting anyone sitting
  behind you.
  <li>No tech is allowed during quizzes or exams (except calculators
  in the latter case).  This includes headphones: no personal
  soundtrack during exams.
  <li>If I ask you to work with other students, refrain from checking
  texts, email, etc, while you talk with them: that's just common courtesy.
  <li>If you're busily working on a paper for another class and just
  want to sit in my class so that maybe you'll absorb information via
  osmosis--well, I've been there.  In that case, though, I'd
  appreciate your sitting in the back of the classroom, and giving me
  some warning so I won't try to get your attention.  Please don't
  make it a habit.
  <li>Do not overestimate your ability to multitask.  Studies
  show that humans are generally a lot worse at it than we think.  If
  you have a laptop or phone out, you're going to feel tempted to surf
  the web or text a friend "just for a minute", and soon you've
  completely forgotten about the class.  I've been <i>there</i>, too.  Be
  aware of yourself, and if you are an impulsive type and can't resist
  the allure of the Internet, put the temptation away.  You're paying
  big bucks to be in lecture; don't squander the opportunity.
  <li>I reserve the right to introduce a tech ban if I feel this
  policy is being abused--e.g. if everyone is buried in their
  cellphones while I'm trying to talk to y'all.  I'm a teacher; I like
  attention. :)
</ul>
</div>
<h3>Extra Credit?</h3>
<div class="section">
  There is plenty of normal credit available in class.  The only extra
  credit available in class is the occasional extra credit problem on
  an exam or homework set.  I do not accept extra credit projects, papers, etc.
</div>
<h3>Talk to Me!</h3>
<div class="section">
<p>  I am usually on campus from 10am (or earlier) through 4:30pm, Monday through
  Friday.  I live in Toledo, but can be reached via email until 11pm.  I receive
  text messages via email, and am usually always logged into AOL
  Instant Messenger; for other forms of chat it's best to email me
  first to make sure I'm available.</p>
<p>  My Facebook account (if you find it) is
  private, and strictly for family and such; please don't be offended if I
  ignore your friend request.</p>
  <p>If you run into difficulty with the material, if an unexpected
  emergency comes up which makes it hard to come to class or complete
  assignments, if you don't like the way I'm teaching: please tell me.
  I will do all that I can to help, within the framework of fairness
  to your fellow students.  Generally speaking, <br/><center><b>The earlier I know
  about a problem, the more I can do to help.</b></center></p>
