<h3><a name="Objectives">Student Learning Objectives</a></h3>
<div class="section">
On successful completion of this course, you will be able to do the
  following:
<ol>
  <h4>Special Relativity</h4>
    <li>State the fundamental postulates of special relativity, and
    explain how special relativity deviates from classical physics
    with regard to simultaneity, time dilation, length contraction.
    <li>Use spacetime diagrams and the spacetime interval to analyze
    events.
<h4>Wave-Particle Duality</h4>
    <li>Identify the differences between waves and particles.
    <li>Discuss several examples where light displays particle-like
    properties, and where matter has wave-like properties.
    <li>Calculate the wavelength and frequency of the wavefunction of
    a free particle.
    <li>Explain the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, and use it in
    calculations.
<h4>Wavefunctions</h4>
  <li>Describe the physical interpretation of an object's
    wavefunction.
    <li>State the Schrodinger equation, in time-independent and
    time-dependent forms, and explain its features.
    <li>Discuss the differences between bound and unbound states.
    <li>Define stationary state.
    <li>Describe the stationary states of certain one-dimensional
    potentials.
    <li>Calculate the expectation values and uncertainties of certain
    properties of wavefunctions.
    <li>Explain what quantum tunnelling is, and how it works.
    <li>Explain why the electron in a hydrogen atom doesn't crash into
    the proton, and can only exist in certain energy levels.
    <!--<li><i>Define degeneracy.  Give some examples of how degeneracies
    in the hydrogen atom can be split.</i> (Not sure about this one.)-->
<h4>Statistical Mechanics</h4>
  <li>Describe the relationship between entropy and temperature.
    <li>Use the Boltzmann distribution to calculate the probability of
    a system being in a certain state.
    <li>Describe the difference between bosons and fermions.  Use the
    Bose-Einstein and Fermi-Dirac distributions to calculate the
    average occupancy of energy levels for such particles.
    <li>Explain the equipartition theorem, and use it in calculations.
<h4>Solids</h4>
  <li>Discuss the properties of a crystalline solid, including the
  crystal lattice; the difference between covalent, ionic, 
metallic, and molecular solids; and the difference between conductors,
insulators, and semiconductors.
    <li>Describe the properties of semiconductors, how they arise, and
some practical uses for them.
    <li>Define superconductivity, describe how it works, and discuss
the difference between Type-I and Type-II superconductors.
<h4>Nuclear Physics</h4>
<li>Discuss the structure of an atomic nucleus, and the conditions
for its stability.
    <li>Describe alpha, beta, and gamma decay, and the process of
radioactive decay.
    <li>Describe the processes of nuclear fission and nuclear fusion.
<h4>Particle Physics</h4>
<li>Describe the four fundamental forces, and identify the
mediating particle for each.
    <li>Explain what antimatter is.
    <li>Explain how particle accelerators work, and what we use them
for.
    <li>Describe the three fundamental symmetries in particle physics,
and give examples of when they are violated.

<h3><a name="Tech">Technology Requirements</a></h3>
<div class="section optional">
  Class assignments, solutions, and news will be posted
  on the <b>class website</b>: <a
  href="http://370.scotthill.us">http://370.scotthill.us</a>
  <p>I will post audio recordings of lectures online, and use a
  virtual whiteboard which can be saved to the website as well.  These
  are for your convenience when you cannot make it to lecture; they are not meant to be a substitute for regular lecture attendance.  Occasionally there is a technical difficulty which prevents the notes from a class from being posted, and you are still responsible for the material covered in that lecture, so don't become too reliant on the online notes.</p>

<!--<h3>University Policies</h3>
<div class="section permanent">
Policy Statement on Non-Discrimination on the basis of Disability
  (ADA): The University is an equal opportunity educational
  institution. Please read The Universityâ€™s <A HREF="https://www.utoledo.edu/policies/administration/diversity/pdfs/3364_50_03_Nondiscrimination_o.pdf">Policy Statement on Nondiscrimination on the Basis of Disability--Americans with Disability Act Compliance.</A>
</div>-->
<h3 class="ongoing"><a name="Grading">Grading</a></h3>
<div class="section">
<ul>
  <li><h4>Homework (20%)</h4>
  Weekly homework will be posted on <b>Mondays</b> on the class
  website, and collected the following Monday in class (unless
  otherwise specified).  Homework is due by the end of class for full
  credit; late homework will be accepted through the following class
  for half credit <i>unless prior arrangements are made.</i> (It never
  hurts to ask.)  The two lowest homework grades will be dropped.
  Depending on my whim that week, I might grade all problems in
  complete detail, or I might grade one or two problems at random, or
  I might just give you credit for completing the work.  You should
  always review the solutions (found on the website) after turning in
  the assignment.
  <li><h4>Quizzes (20%)</h4>
  Weekly ten-minute quizzes will be given at the beginning of class on most
  <b>Fridays</b>, on material covered since the previous quiz.
  Quizzes cannot be made up, though they may be excused for valid
  reason (see above). The two lowest quiz grades will be dropped.
  Quizzes will consist of 6 questions, each worth one point, and you get 4
  points just for showing up.
  <li><h4>Midterms (2 x 20%)</h4>
  Two midterms will be given in class.  They are closed-book and
  closed-notes, but students are permitted two sheets of paper, on
  which they may write or print or type or draw anything they choose,
  front and back.  Calculators are permitted (nay, required).  The
  exact dates are to be determined.  Midterm dates are flexible, and I am happy to take
  requests (e.g. to avoid a big exam or project in another class).

<li><h4>Final Exam:</h4> The final exam will be <i>open book</i> and <i>open
    notes</i>, and will be comprehensive, with an emphasis on the
    material not covered on the previous two exams.

</div>

<h3 class="ongoing"><a name="Policies">Academic Policies and Course Expectations</a></h3>
<div class="section">
  <h4>Excused Absences</h4>
  I permit students to make up work for the following reasons:
<ul>
<li> personal emergencies (personal illness, illness of a dependent, or death in the family);
<li> religious observances that prevent the student from attending class;
<li> college-sponsored activities, approved by the appropriate authority;
<li> government-required activities (such as jury duty or military service)
</ul>
The following conditions must also hold:
<ul>
<li> the student contacts the instructor <i>before the class begins</i>, unless this was demonstrably impossible, using one of the following mechanisms: written note, email, telephone, or IM.  When feasible, it is better to use two communication mechanisms, as the student is responsible for failed communications (e.g. wrong number, lost email, etc).  Note that telling me in person about an absence is <i>not</i> acceptable, as I am responsible for over a hundred students and can't easily keep track of you all.
<li> the instructor is provided with acceptable documentation (e.g., a note from a doctor in the case of illness, a note from a coach in case of an athletic event, a program from a funeral or religious event, etc).
</ul>
Quizzes missed due to excused absences will simply be excluded from
the student's quiz average; nor will they count as one of the
student's ``dropped'' quiz grades.  Missed exams may be made up during
office hours as a written or oral exam, at the instructor's discretion.  Homework will be accepted late without penalty in these circumstances, with a revised due date determined by the instructor (with student input).
<h4>Distractions:</h4> Mobile phones and other noisemakers must be silenced during lecture; violators will be mocked.  If you must take or make a phone call, please retire to the hallway to do so.  You may not use a cell phone for any reason during exams (including as a calculator).  If you <i>must</i> eat, play games, or engage in any other behavior which is mildly distracting to your fellow students or the instructor, please sit in the back of the classroom.  The instructor will ask you to stop or leave if you are too distracting.  If <B>you</B> find another student's behavior to be distracting, and don't want to confront her or him yourself,  please let the instructor know.</li>

<h4>Tardiness:</h4>
If you are <i>late</i> for an exam, come anyway; I might be able to
accommodate you, provided that you arrive before the end of the exam
period.
<h4>Withdrawal:</h4>
TBD
<!--<ul>
  <li>The deadline to <b>drop</b> this course is <u>January 25th</u>.
  (It will not show up on your transcript in that case.)
  <li>You may <b>withdraw</b> from this course at any time before
  <u>March 25th</u>. (The class will be listed on your transcript with
  a grade of W.)
</ul>
Both are done by the student through the Registrar; the instructor cannot drop or withdraw students (although he would appreciate being notified of the withdrawal).  Incompletes are only given in rare circumstances.-->
<h4>Extra Credit:</h4> The only extra credit available in class is the
occasional extra credit problem on an exam or homework set.  I do not
accept extra credit projects, papers, etc.  (However, there is plenty
of normal credit available in class.)
<h4>Talk to me!</h4> If you run into difficulty with the material, if an unexpected emergency comes up which makes it hard to come to class or complete assignments, if you don't like the way I'm teaching: please tell me.  I will do all that I can to help, within the framework of fairness to your fellow students.  Generally speaking, <i>the earlier I know about a problem, the more I can do to help.</i>
</div>

<h3>Academic Accommodations</h3>
<div class="section permanent">
TBD once I learn more about the procedures at Adrian.  Generally
  speaking, if you have a disability and require special
  accommodations during quizzes, exams, etc, you should let me know as
  soon as possible.
