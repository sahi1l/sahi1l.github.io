With the use of simple models, we use statistical analysis to derive quantities such as temperature, pressure, and entropy, determine the properties of a material at equilibrium, and analyze the flow of energy, in the form of heat and work, between macroscopic systems.
</p></div><h3><span class="switch">▼</span>HLC Credit Hour Statement
</h3><div>The credit hour calculation includes a 1 hour weekly meeting, 2 hours of reading the textbook (including working through derivations and example problems), and 4 hours a week working on homework problems. The course will cover 13 weeks, for a total of (1+2+4)× 13 = 91 hours of effort, sufficient for a two-credit course.
</div><h3><span class="switch">▼</span><a name="Goals">Course Goals</a></h3><div class="section">On successful completion of this course, you will be able to do the following:<div class="section"><ul><li>Identify and distinguish forms of energy in thermal physics</li><li>Compute energy exchange during thermodynamic processes</li><li>Explain the concept of entropy and its application to many-particle physical systems</li><li>Calculate the probability of many-particle macrostates using statistical methods</li><li>Work with a variety of practical thermodynamics systems and processes</li><li>Solve advanced quantitative problems involving thermodynamic concepts</li></ul></div>

<h3>Academic Accommodations</h3>
<div class="section permanent">
If you have a disability, which may affect your performance in class, let me know as soon as possible.  Students with disabilities must self-advocate.  You will need to provide recent, appropriate documentation, which verifies the need for reasonable academic accommodation.  A copy of all documents is retained by Danielle Ward in the Office of Academic Services (Jones Hall).  Email Danielle at dward@adrian.edu or ask for her in Academic Services. (Statement used with permission)
</div>
<h3>Academic Integrity</h3>
<div class="section">
<p>Cheating of any kind is a violation of the college’s Academic
  Integrity Policy (See Student Handbook). For example, if a student
  plagiarizes by copying the work of another person with the intention
  of deceptively representing that work as his or her own, the student
  will receive a zero for that assignment. The Assistant Dean of
  Student Affairs will be informed and it will be noted on the
  student’s permanent record.  A second offense may result in failure
  of the course.</p>
  <p>It is permissible to work with other students on homework
  assignments; however, once you understand how to do the problem, you
  should write up the solution in your own words.  Do not copy down a
  solution that has been prepared by a group.  Exams and quizzes are to be completed with no assistance from
  anyone else.</p>

</div>

<h3>Technology in the Classroom</h3>
<div class="section">
You are permitted to use laptops, tablets, cellphones, etc (hereafter
  referred to as "tech") during lectures, with the following caveats.
<ul>
  <li>Your tech must not bother anyone else.  Silence cellphones, and
  make sure your screen isn't bothering or distracting anyone sitting
  behind you.
  <li>No tech is allowed during quizzes or exams (except calculators
  in the latter case).  This includes headphones: no personal
  soundtrack during exams.
  <li>If I ask you to work with other students, refrain from checking
  texts, email, etc, while you talk with them: that's just rude.
  <li>If you're busily working on a paper for another class but just
  want to sit in my class so that maybe you'll absorb information via
  osmosis==well, I've been there.  In that case, though, I'd
  appreciate your sitting in the back of the classroom, and giving me
  some warning so I won't try to get your attention.
  <li>Please don't overestimate your ability to multitask.  Studies
  show that humans are generally a lot worse at it than we think.  If
  you have a laptop or phone out, you're going to feel tempted to surf
  the web or text a friend "just for a minute", and soon you've
  completely forgotten about the class.  I've been <i>there</i>, too.  Be
  aware of yourself, and if you are an impulsive type and can't resist
  the allure of the Internet, put the temptation away.  You're paying
  big bucks to be in lecture; don't squander the opportunity.
  <li>I reserve the right to introduce a tech ban if I feel this
  policy is being abused==e.g. if everyone is buried in their
  cellphones while I'm trying to talk to y'all.  I'm a teacher; I like
  attention. :)

</div>--><!--<h3>Extra Credit?</h3>
<div class="section">
  There is plenty of normal credit available in class.  The only extra
  credit available in class is the occasional extra credit problem on
  an exam or homework set.  I do not accept extra credit projects, papers, etc.
</div>
<h3>Talk to Me!</h3>
<div class="section">
  <p>If you run into difficulty with the material, if an unexpected
  emergency comes up which makes it hard to come to class or complete
  assignments, if you don't like the way I'm teaching: please tell me.
  I will do all that I can to help, within the framework of fairness
  to your fellow students.  Generally speaking, <i>the earlier I know
  about a problem, the more I can do to help.</i></p>
<p>  I will usually be on campus between 10am and 5pm, Monday through
  Friday.  I live in Toledo, but can be reached via email until 11pm.  (I receive
  text messages via email, and am usually always logged into AOL
  Instant Messenger; for other forms of chat it's best to email me
  first to make sure I"m available.</p>
<p>  My Facebook account (if you find it) is
  private, and strictly for family and such; please don't be offended if I
  ignore your friend request.</p>
