  <i>College Physics: A Strategic Approach</i>, 3rd edition, by Knight,
  Jones, and Field (2014). ISBN 0-13-416783-X.  You will also need an
  access code for the online homework system <b>Mastering Physics</b>.  <I>The college bookstore lists a
  hardcover version and an ebook version; you do not need both!</i>
  <h4>Calculator</h4>
<img height=100px src="../../lib/img/calculator.png" style="float:left;padding-right:10px;">
  A scientific calculator is required.  It must have the trigonometric
  functions and scientific notation; it need not (but can be) a
  graphing calculator.  Bring your calculator to all classes and
  exams, unless otherwise notified.  Needless to say, you may not
  share calculators during exams, or use a cell phone, laptop, or
  similar device during exams.
  <h4 style="clear:left">Letter Cards</h4>
  <img height=100px src="../../lib/img/cards.png" style="float:right;padding-left:10px;">
  At the beginning of the semester, you will be supplied with a set of
  6 large color cards labelled A through F.  You will use them to
  answer multiple-choice questions in class.  Please bring them with
  you to every lecture.
 
</div>

<h3><a name="Website">Website</a></h3>
<div class="section optional">
  Class assignments, solutions, and news will be posted
  on the <b>class website</b>: <a href="http://101.scotthill.us/">http://101.scotthill.us</a>
  <p>I will post audio recordings of lectures online, and use a
  virtual whiteboard which can be saved to the website as well.  These
  are for your convenience when you cannot make it to lecture; they are 
not meant to be a substitute for regular lecture attendance.  
Occasionally there is a technical difficulty which prevents the notes 
from a class from being posted, and you are still responsible for the 
material covered in that lecture, so don't become too reliant on the 
online notes.</p>

<h3 class="ongoing"><a name="Grading">Grading</a></h3>
<div class="section">
<ul>
  <li><h4>Homework (20%)</h4>
  Homework will be assigned online each week through the Mastering
  Physics system, and will be due by <b>Saturday mornings</b> at
  <b>noon</b>.  The two lowest homework grades will be dropped.
  <li><h4>Quizzes (20%)</h4>
  Weekly ten-minute quizzes will be given at the beginning of class on most
  <b>Wednesdays</b>, on material covered since the previous quiz.
  Quizzes cannot be made up, though they may be excused for valid
  reason (see <a href="#excused_absences">"Excused Absences"</a> under
  Policies.). The two lowest quiz grades will be dropped.
  Quizzes will consist of 6 questions, each worth one point, and you get 4
  points just for showing up.
  <li><h4>Midterms (2 x 20%)</h4>
  Two midterms will be given in class.  They are closed-book and
  closed-notes, but students are permitted <b>one</b> sheet of paper, on
  which they may write or print or type or draw anything they choose,
  front and back.  Calculators are permitted (nay, required).  The
  exact dates are to be determined.  Midterm dates are flexible, and
  if you have a big exam or project in another class, we can talk
  about how to avoid it.  The first midterm will be <b>no sooner than
  September 26th</b>, and the second midterm will be <b>no sooner than
  October 31st</b>.

<li><h4>Final Exam (20%):</h4> The final exam will be comprehensive,
  with an emphasis on the material not covered on the previous two
  exams.  The rules are the same as for the midterms except that you
  are permitted <b>two</b> sheets of paper.

<h3 class="ongoing"><a name="Excuses">Excused Absences</a></h3>
<div class="section">
  Typically, a quiz or homework that isn't completed in time will
  receive a zero (possibly counting as one of the "dropped"
  assignments for each category).  The exception is when you miss
  class due to an <i>excused absence</i>.
  <h4>How can I qualify for an excused absence?</h4>
  <ol>
    <li>Have a good reason for your absence.
    <li>Contact me <b>before the missed class begins</b>, unless
    this is demonstrably impossible.  Contact should be via written
    note, email, telephone, SMS, IM, etc.  Simply telling me during
    class is not sufficient, because I will forget.  You are
    responsible for failed communication (wrong number, lost email,
    etc).  The sooner you let me know, the better.
    <li>Within a week after returning to class, you must provide the
    instructor with some sort of documentation for your absence: a
    doctor's note, an athletic calendar, etc.  If you're not sure what
    qualifies as documentation, we will work something out.
  </ol>
  <h4>What qualifies as a "good" reason?</h4>
  They generally fall into one of four categories:
  <ul>
    <li><b>personal emergencies</b> (illness, death in the family, etc).
    <li><b>religious observances</b> that prevent the student from attending
    class
    <li><b>college-sponsored activities</b> (including athletics); note that
    rehearsals and practices do <i>not</i> generally count as excused
    absences according to college policy.
    <li><b>government-mandated activities</b>, such as jury duty or military
    service
  </ul>
  If you're not sure if something counts, please don't hesitate to ask
  me.  Excuses for missed homework will be judged more stringently
  because they do not require your presence in class.
  <h4>What happens if I get an excused absence?</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>For <b>quizzes</b>, it will be as if that quiz never existed
    for you.  It will <i>not</i> count as one of your dropped quizzes.
    <li>For <b>homework</b>, you will be expected to complete it as soon
    after the class as possible.  We will work out a new due date for
    you in that instance.
    <li>For <b>exams</b>, we will schedule a makeup exam in my office
    as soon as possible.  This will either be in written or oral form,
    at my discretion.
  </ul>
  <h4>What if I'm late to a quiz or exam?</h4>
  Come anyway!  It's a lot easier to give you a little extra time,
  than to find a whole extra hour to squeeze you in.
  <h4>Do I have to let you know if I'm going to miss a class and
  there's no quiz or exam that day?</h4>
  No; attendance is not required.  I trust you to choose your own priorities.

<h2 style="font-weight:900;font-size:200%"><a name="Policies">Policies</a></h2>
<h3>Academic Accommodations</h3>
<div class="section permanent">
If you have a disability, which may affect your performance in class, 
let me know as soon as possible.  Students with disabilities must 
self-advocate.  You will need to provide recent, appropriate 
documentation, which verifies the need for reasonable academic 
accommodation.  A copy of all documents is retained by Danielle Ward in 
the Office of Academic Services (Jones Hall).  Email Danielle at 
dward@adrian.edu or ask for her in Academic Services. (Statement used 
with permission)
</div>
<h3>Academic Integrity</h3>
<div class="section">
<p>Cheating of any kind is a violation of the college’s Academic
  Integrity Policy (See Student Handbook). For example, if a student
  plagiarizes by copying the work of another person with the intention
  of deceptively representing that work as his or her own, the student
  will receive a zero for that assignment. The Assistant Dean of
  Student Affairs will be informed and it will be noted on the
  student’s permanent record.  A second offense may result in failure
  of the course.</p>
  <p>It is permissible to work with other students on homework
  assignments; however, once you understand how to do the problem, you
  should write up the solution in your own words.  Do not copy down a
  solution that has been prepared by a group.  Exams and quizzes are to be completed with no assistance from
  anyone else.</p>

</div>

<h3>Technology in the Classroom</h3>
<div class="section">
You are permitted to use laptops, tablets, cellphones, etc (hereafter
  referred to as "tech") during lectures, with the following caveats.
<ul>
  <li>Your tech must not bother anyone else.  Silence cellphones, and
  make sure your screen isn't bothering or distracting anyone sitting
  behind you.
  <li>No tech is allowed during quizzes or exams (except calculators
  in the latter case).  This includes headphones: no personal
  soundtrack during exams.
  <li>If I ask you to work with other students, refrain from checking
  texts, email, etc, while you talk with them: that's just rude.
  <li>If you're busily working on a paper for another class but just
  want to sit in my class so that maybe you'll absorb information via
  osmosis--well, I've been there.  In that case, though, I'd
  appreciate your sitting in the back of the classroom, and giving me
  some warning so I won't try to get your attention.
  <li>Please don't overestimate your ability to multitask.  Studies
  show that humans are generally a lot worse at it than we think.  If
  you have a laptop or phone out, you're going to feel tempted to surf
  the web or text a friend "just for a minute", and soon you've
  completely forgotten about the class.  I've been <i>there</i>, too.  Be
  aware of yourself, and if you are an impulsive type and can't resist
  the allure of the Internet, put the temptation away.  You're paying
  big bucks to be in lecture; don't squander the opportunity.
  <li>I reserve the right to introduce a tech ban if I feel this
  policy is being abused--e.g. if everyone is buried in their
  cellphones while I'm trying to talk to y'all.  I'm a teacher; I like
  attention. :)
</ul>

<h3>Extra Credit?</h3>
<div class="section">
  There is plenty of normal credit available in class.  The only extra
  credit available in class is the occasional extra credit problem on
  an exam or homework set.  I do not accept extra credit projects, papers, etc.
</div>
<h3>Talk to Me!</h3>
<div class="section">
  <p>If you run into difficulty with the material, if an unexpected
  emergency comes up which makes it hard to come to class or complete
  assignments, if you don't like the way I'm teaching: please tell me.
  I will do all that I can to help, within the framework of fairness
  to your fellow students.  Generally speaking, <i>the earlier I know
  about a problem, the more I can do to help.</i></p>
<p>  I will usually be on campus between 10am and 5pm, Monday through
  Friday.  I live in Toledo, but can be reached via email until 11pm.  I receive
  text messages via email, and am usually always logged into AOL
  Instant Messenger; for other forms of chat it's best to email me
  first to make sure I'm available.</p>
<p>  My Facebook account (if you find it) is
  private, and strictly for family and such; please don't be offended if I
  ignore your friend request.</p>
