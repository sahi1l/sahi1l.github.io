<h3><a name="Description">Description</a></h3>
<div class="section">
<p><i>An introduction to the fundamentals of modern physics.  Topics
  include special relativity, quantum theory, atomic physics,
  statistical physics, condensed-matter physics, nuclear structure,
  and elementary particles.</i> (Catalog)</p>
  <p>"Modern" is a bit of a misnomer here: we're talking about physics
  largely discovered in the beginning of the 20th century (relativity,
  quantum mechanics) or even earlier (statistical physics).  This is a
  bit of an upper-level "survey" course, and while there will be
  advanced mathematics, the emphasis will be on conceptual
  understanding of a variety of phenomena.  Well ok, "understanding"
  might be a bit too strong when it comes to quantum mechanics...</p>
  <p><i>“It is often stated that of all the theories proposed in this
  century, the silliest is quantum theory. In fact, some say that the
  only thing that quantum theory has going for it is that it is
  unquestionably correct.”</i> --Michio Kaku, <i>Hyperspace</i>

<h3>Course Overview</h3>
<div class="section optional">
</div>
-->
<h3><a name="Prereqs">Prerequisites</a></h3>
<div class="section">
  <span style="padding-left:10px">This class builds on topics from
  introductory physics in a calculus-based setting.  You are expected
  to be comfortable with partial derivatives and multiple integrals.
  Prerequisites of the course are</span>
  <ul>
  <li><b>PHYS 206</b>: (General Physics II)
  <li><b>MATH 215</b> (Calculus and Analytic Geometry III) <br/><u>or</u> <b>MATH 305</b>
    (Differential Equations)
    </ul>
</div>


<h3><a name="Objectives">Learning Objectives</a></h3>
<div class="section">
On successful completion of this course, you will be able to do the
  following:
<ol>
  <h4>Special Relativity</h4>
    <li>State the fundamental postulates of special relativity, and
    explain how special relativity deviates from classical physics
    with regard to simultaneity, time dilation, length contraction.
    <li>Use spacetime diagrams and the spacetime interval to analyze
    events.
<h4>Wave-Particle Duality</h4>
    <li>Identify the differences between waves and particles.
    <li>Discuss several examples where light displays particle-like
    properties, and where matter has wave-like properties.
    <li>Calculate the wavelength and frequency of the wavefunction of
    a free particle.
    <li>Explain the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, and use it in
    calculations.
<h4>Wavefunctions</h4>
  <li>Describe the physical interpretation of an object's
    wavefunction.
    <li>State the Schrodinger equation, in time-independent and
    time-dependent forms, and explain its features.
    <li>Discuss the differences between bound and unbound states.
    <li>Define stationary state.
    <li>Describe the stationary states of certain one-dimensional
    potentials.
    <li>Calculate the expectation values and uncertainties of certain
    properties of wavefunctions.
    <li>Explain what quantum tunnelling is, and how it works.
    <li>Explain why the electron in a hydrogen atom doesn't crash into
    the proton, and can only exist in certain energy levels.
    <!--<li><i>Define degeneracy.  Give some examples of how degeneracies
    in the hydrogen atom can be split.</i> (Not sure about this one.)-->
<h4>Statistical Mechanics</h4>
  <li>Describe the relationship between entropy and temperature.
    <li>Use the Boltzmann distribution to calculate the probability of
    a system being in a certain state.
    <li>Describe the difference between bosons and fermions.  Use the
    Bose-Einstein and Fermi-Dirac distributions to calculate the
    average occupancy of energy levels for such particles.
    <li>Explain the equipartition theorem, and use it in calculations.
<h4>Solids</h4>
  <li>Discuss the properties of a crystalline solid, including the
  crystal lattice; the difference between covalent, ionic, 
metallic, and molecular solids; and the difference between conductors,
insulators, and semiconductors.
    <li>Describe the properties of semiconductors, how they arise, and
some practical uses for them.
    <li>Define superconductivity, describe how it works, and discuss
the difference between Type-I and Type-II superconductors.
<h4>Nuclear Physics</h4>
<li>Discuss the structure of an atomic nucleus, and the conditions
for its stability.
    <li>Describe alpha, beta, and gamma decay, and the process of
radioactive decay.
    <li>Describe the processes of nuclear fission and nuclear fusion.
<h4>Particle Physics</h4>
<li>Describe the four fundamental forces, and identify the
mediating particle for each.
    <li>Explain what antimatter is.

<h3 class="ongoing"><a name="Grading">Grading</a></h3>
<div class="section">
<ul>
  <li><h4>Homework (20%)</h4>
  Weekly homework will be posted on <b>Mondays</b> on the class
  website, and collected the following Monday in class (unless
  otherwise specified).  Homework is due by the end of class for full
  credit; late homework will be accepted through the following class
  at a 20% penalty, <i>unless prior arrangements are made.</i> (It never
  hurts to ask.)  The two lowest homework grades will be dropped.
  Depending on my whim that week, I might grade all problems in
  complete detail, or I might grade one or two problems at random, or
  I might just give you credit for completing the work.  You should
  always review the solutions (found on the website) after turning in
  the assignment.
  <li><h4>Quizzes (20%)</h4>
  Weekly ten-minute quizzes will be given at the beginning of class on most
  <b>Fridays</b>, on material covered since the previous quiz.
  Quizzes cannot be made up, though they may be excused for valid
  reason (see <a href="#Excuses">"Excused Absences"</a>). The two lowest quiz grades will be dropped.
  Quizzes will consist of 6 questions, each worth one point, and you get 4
  points just for showing up.
  <li><h4>Midterms (2 x 20%)</h4>
  Two midterms will be given in class.  They are closed-book and
  closed-notes, but students are permitted two sheets of paper, on
  which they may write or print or type or draw anything they choose,
  front and back.  Calculators are permitted (nay, required).  The
  exact dates are to be determined.  Midterm dates are flexible, and
  if you have a big exam or project in another class, we can talk
  about how to avoid it.

<li><h4>Final Exam (20%):</h4> The final exam will be <i>open book</i> and <i>open
    notes</i>, and will be comprehensive, with an emphasis on the
    material not covered on the previous two exams.

<h3 class="ongoing"><a name="Excuses">Excused Absences</a></h3>
<div class="section">
  Typically, a quiz or homework assignment that isn't completed in time will
  receive a zero (possibly counting as one of the "dropped"
  assignments for each category).  The exception is when you miss
  class due to an <i>excused absence</i>.
  <h4>How can I qualify for an excused absence?</h4>
  <ol>
    <li>Have a good reason for your absence.
    <li>Contact me <b>before the missed class begins</b>, unless
    this is demonstrably impossible.  Contact should be via written
    note, email, telephone, SMS, IM, etc.  Simply telling me during
    class is not sufficient, because I will forget.  You are
    responsible for failed communication (wrong number, lost email,
    etc).  The sooner you let me know, the better.
    <li>Within a week after returning to class, you must provide the
    instructor with some sort of documentation for your absence: a
    doctor's note, an athletic calendar, etc.  If you're not sure what
    qualifies as documentation, we will work something out.
  </ol>
  <h4>What qualifies as a "good" reason?</h4>
  They generally fall into one of four categories:
  <ul>
    <li><b>personal emergencies</b> (illness, death in the family, etc).
    <li><b>religious observances</b> that prevent the student from attending
    class
    <li><b>government-mandated activities</b>, such as jury duty or military
    service
    <li><b>college-sponsored activities</b> (including athletics); note that
    rehearsals and practices do <i>not</i> generally count as excused
    absences according to college policy.  If you have your schedule
    of games or performances (etc), please send it to me before the
    end of the first week of class.
  </ul>
<p>  If you're not sure if something counts, please don't hesitate to ask
  me.</p>
  <h4>What happens if I get an excused absence?</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>For <b>quizzes</b>, it will be as if that quiz never existed
    for you.  It will <i>not</i> count as one of your dropped quizzes.  I do not give makeup quizzes because the quiz solutions are posted almost immediately after class.  (An exception may be made if a large number of quizzes are missed, at my discretion.)
    <li>For <b>homework</b>, you will be expected to submit it as soon
    after the class as possible.  We will work out a new due date for
    you in that instance.  Note that you can email me your homework or
    slide it under my door on the day it's due with no penalty.
    <li>For <b>exams</b>, we will schedule a makeup exam in my office
    as soon as possible.  This will either be in written or oral form,
    at my discretion.
  </ul>
  <h4>What if I'm late to a quiz or exam?</h4>
  Come anyway!  It's a lot easier to give you a little extra time,
  than to find a whole extra hour to squeeze you in.
  <h4>Do I have to let you know if I'm going to miss a class and
  there's no homework or quiz that day?</h4>
  No; attendance is not required.
</div>

<h3 class="ongoing"><a name="Schedule">Course Schedule</a></h3>

<h3><a name="Tutoring">Tutoring</a></h3>
<div class="section">
Adrian College provides students with <A HREF="http://adrian.edu/academics/academic-services/tutoring/">free tutoring</A>.  To request a tutor, contact Lonnie Pugh at lpugh@adrian.edu.
</div>

<h2 style="font-weight:900;font-size:200%"><a name="Policies">Policies</a></h2>
<h3>Academic Accommodations</h3>
<div class="section permanent">
<p>If you have a disability, which may affect your performance in class, 
let me know as soon as possible.  Students with disabilities must 
self-advocate.  You will need to provide recent, appropriate 
documentation, which verifies the need for reasonable academic 
accommodation.  A copy of all documents is retained by Danielle Ward in 
the Office of Academic Services (Jones Hall).  Email Danielle at 
dward@adrian.edu or ask for her in Academic Services. (Statement used 
with permission)</p>
</div>
<h3>Academic Integrity</h3>
<div class="section">
<p>Cheating of any kind is a violation of the college’s Academic
  Integrity Policy (See Student Handbook). For example, if a student
  plagiarizes by copying the work of another person with the intention
  of deceptively representing that work as his or her own, the student
  will receive a zero for that assignment. The Assistant Dean of
  Student Affairs will be informed and it will be noted on the
  student’s permanent record.  A second offense may result in failure
  of the course.</p>
  <p>It is permissible to work with other students on homework
  assignments; however, once you understand how to do the problem, you
  should write up the solution in your own words.  Do not copy down a
  solution that has been prepared by a group.  Exams and quizzes are to be completed with no assistance from
  anyone else.</p>

</div>

<h3>Technology in the Classroom</h3>
<div class="section">
You are permitted to use laptops, tablets, cellphones, etc (hereafter
  referred to as "tech") during lectures, with the following caveats.
<ul>
  <li>Your tech must not bother anyone else.  Turn off the volume, and
  make sure your screen isn't bothering or distracting anyone sitting
  behind you.
  <li>No tech is allowed during quizzes or exams (except calculators
  in the latter case).  This includes headphones: no personal
  soundtrack during exams.
  <li>If I ask you to work with other students, refrain from checking
  texts, email, etc, while you talk with them: that's just common courtesy.
  <li>If you're busily working on a paper for another class and just
  want to sit in my class so that maybe you'll absorb information via
  osmosis--well, I've been there.  In that case, though, I'd
  appreciate your sitting in the back of the classroom, and giving me
  some warning so I won't try to get your attention.  Please don't make it a habit.
  <li>Do not overestimate your ability to multitask.  Studies
  show that humans are generally a lot worse at it than we think.  If
  you have a laptop or phone out, you're going to feel tempted to surf
  the web or text a friend "just for a minute", and soon you've
  completely forgotten about the class.  I've been <i>there</i>, too.  Be
  aware of yourself, and if you are an impulsive type and can't resist
  the allure of the Internet, put the temptation away.  You're paying
  big bucks to be in lecture; don't squander the opportunity.
  <li>I reserve the right to introduce a tech ban if I feel this
  policy is being abused--e.g. if everyone is buried in their
  cellphones while I'm trying to talk to y'all.  I'm a teacher; I like
  attention. :)
</ul>
</div>
<!--<h3><a name="Communication">Communicating with Me</a></h3>
<div class="section">
I will typically be on campus be 
</div>-->
<h3>Extra Credit?</h3>
<div class="section">
  There is plenty of normal credit available in class.  The only extra
  credit available in class is the occasional extra credit problem on
  an exam or homework set.  I do not accept extra credit projects, papers, etc.
</div>
<h3>Talk to Me!</h3>
<div class="section">
<p>  I am usually on campus from 10am (or earlier) through 4:30pm, Monday through
  Friday.  I live in Toledo, but can be reached via email until 11pm.  I receive
  text messages via email, and am usually always logged into AOL
  Instant Messenger; for other forms of chat it's best to email me
  first to make sure I'm available.</p>
<p>  My Facebook account (if you find it) is
  private, and strictly for family and such; please don't be offended if I
  ignore your friend request.</p>
<p> This semester I thought I would experiment with an online chat room system called MathIM, which allows one to include equations.  There's no need to register; you simply visit <A HREF="http://mathim.com/adrianphysics370">http://mathim.com/adrianphysics370</A> and choose a username.  Note that this is an open chat room, so your classmates will be able to read what you say: there are other choices if you need to have a private conversation about grades or other things.  I will be curious to know if you find the system useful.
  <p>If you run into difficulty with the material, if an unexpected
  emergency comes up which makes it hard to come to class or complete
  assignments, if you don't like the way I'm teaching: please tell me.
  I will do all that I can to help, within the framework of fairness
  to your fellow students.  Generally speaking, <br/><center><b>The earlier I know
  about a problem, the more I can do to help.</b></center></p>
