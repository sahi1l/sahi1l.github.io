12/14: I've posted the final exam and the final overall grades on Blackboard.  May all your surprises be pleasant ones.  (The final went very well overall, actually, even if it was as long as blazes.)  I hope you have Happy Holidays and a relaxing break.  I look forward to seeing eight of you for Quantum in January.  To all of you, best wishes!
12/6: A couple of corrections for the exam: <ul><li>In problem 4, the momentum should be in units of eV/<i>c</i>, not eV/<i>c</i><sup>2</sup>. <li>The term "rest mass", which I use a couple of times, should really just be "mass".  Mass is mass no matter whether an object is moving or not. Mass is equal to rest energy, though, which is where I've been getting the word "rest" from.</ul> If you would like an updated copy of the exam with these tiny corrections, email me and I'll send it along. 
12/6: Solutions to [HW11S.pdf HW11] and [HW12S.pdf HW12] are now posted; so sorry I didn't get them up sooner.
12/5: <B>The final exam has been sent out via email</B>, to your Adrian email address. If you didn't get it, let me know.
12/4: I'm afraid the exam isn't ready yet; it's taking longer to write than I had hoped. I am <i>so</i> close to done, but I want to give it one more lookthrough in the morning to make sure it's not insane, so I will email it out to you Monday morning.  If a Friday afternoon deadline is going to be a problem because of the delay, please email me TODAY and we will figure it out.
12/2: Review outlines for [Chapter9.pdf Chapter 9] and [Chapter10.pdf Chapter 10] are now available, in a similar style to the outlines for 11 and 12.
11/30: OK, OK, HW12 is due on Monday.
11/27: I will accept HW11 on Wednesday.  Please note that HW12 has also been assigned and is due on Friday.
11/26: I just realized that I didn't include the figure in [HW11.pdf HW11].  The corrected assignment is now available.
11/25: Here is the [Chapter12.pdf reading guide] for Chapter 12.  I'd like to talk about it on Wednesday and Friday of the last week.  Also, the last homework assignment is now posted.  The final exam will be available online the weekend after the last class, and will be due the Friday of finals week.
11/20: On second thought, I am not going to have your exams graded by tomorrow's class; I really want to give myself enough time to read what y'all have written and to do it right.  If it is killing you not to know what your grade is because you're an anxious sort, let me know and I can prioritize your exam (or at least give you a rough idea.)
11/17: For Monday's class, I would like you to read Chapter 11 in the textbook, and be prepared to answer the questions in this <A HREF="Repository/Chapter11.pdf">reading guide</A>.  This is not for a grade, but to facilitate our covering of the material before the end of the semester.  I will post a similar reading guide for Particle Physics (Chapter 12) which I will ask you to read over the break.
11/12: I've had to remove the audio files from some of the earlier classes, to make space on my webhost.  If you need any of them, let me know.
11/11: Just to clarify what I would like for the exam: please print out the exam and write the answers to each problem on the printout.  If you can fit your work onto the printout as well, that's fine; otherwise, show your work on a separate attached page, and then write the answer on the printout.  (If the answer is correct I won't need to refer to the work, which will save me time.)
11/10: The [Exam2.pdf exam] is now available.  I've labelled it "v1" in case I need to make any corrections and release a new version.  Please let me know if you have any questions or problems.  The exam is due next Friday the 18th in class.
11/9: I was going to finish writing your exam last night but...well, last night happened.  Rather than rush through it today, I'm going to post it tomorrow.  You'll still have a week to complete it.
11/7: Barring total failure on my part, I will hand out Exam 2 on Wednesday of this week, and it will be due the following Wednesday.  (You will get a week to do it, regardless.)
11/5: I've uploaded an [Exam2Outline.pdf outline] for Exam 2.
10/31: You might be interested in reading about [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perpetual_motion Perpetual motion machines] and some of the methods that have been proposed to skirt the laws of physics.
10/28: Here's my [http://physics.nfshost.com/3410/Diffusion/index.html diffusion demo] from class today, if you want to play with it. 
10/20: (2:55pm) Two small updates: 1) the figure in the solutions to HW7 was incorrect; I had the wavelength increasing in the wrong direction.  2) Problem 1 in HW8 is Harris 5.34, not 5.31.  And it's a 50eV electron, meaning an electron with 50eV total energy (not including rest energy--no relativity here!)
10/12: [HW7.pdf Homework 7] is now available.
10/5: The first exam and its solutions are now available online, under the Exams tab.  Feel free to ignore until after the break, if that sort of thing makes you nervous.  Enjoy your break!
10/3: [HW6S.pdf HW6 solutions] are now available.  (I've just added a figure to problem 2.)
10/1: Quick modification to the last problem on HW6, part b: you don't have to find k_max, just show that it is inversely proportional to L.  Don't kill yourself over it, though.
9/29: Here is the [Exam1Outline.pdf review outline] for the first exam.  Also, here is a [SampleExam.pdf sample] exam I gave to the equivalent of a 208 class; not helpful to study from but it gives you a sense of my "style".
9/27: The first exam will be on <b>Wednesday, October 5th</b>, and will cover chapters 2-4 in Harris.
9/16: There will be NO CLASS on Monday (the 19th).  Please read Chapter 3 of Harris and bring your questions and thoughts about the material to Wednesday's class, along with your solutions to HW4.
9/16: There was a small error in problem 3 of HW3; I forgot the 1/2.  The solutions have been corrected.
9/13: In [HW4.pdf Homework 4], problem 2a, you can drop the minus sign.
9/5: [HW3.pdf Homework 3] has now been posted.  UPDATE: The original said it was "Homework 2"; I've fixed it.
9/1: HW1 solutions are now posted.  UPDATE: I made a small correction to the answer to the last problem: the answer should be 13ns, not 20ns.
8/30: HW2 is now posted; it will be due on Wednesday due to the Labor Day holiday.  Solutions to HW1 will be available tomorrow after class.
8/30: Here are the notes on [intervals.pdf time intervals] which we will talk about in Wednesday's class; the material isn't in your textbook.
8/29: The next homework set will be posted on Tuesday, along with the solutions to HW1.
8/27: Regarding problem 1...it's a bear, isn't it?  Don't get too stuck on it that you don't do the other problems.  Here are a couple hints: <ul><li>When clock C is directly overhead of clock Y, that is an EVENT.  (The perpendicular distance between the clocks is irrelevant.) <li>At an event, the clock readings will be the same for everyone.  C and Y may show different times, but everyone will agree what times those clocks show at the event. <li>The reading on any clock is the time in the clock's frame.</ul>
8/24: There will be no quiz this first week.
8/24: The first homework assignment is now available in the Assignments tab.
8/20: Welcome to Modern Physics!  Please click on the Syllabus button above to learn more about the course.
