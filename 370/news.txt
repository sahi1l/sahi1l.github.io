10/1: Quick modification to the last problem on HW6, part b: you don't have to find k_max, just show that it is inversely proportional to L.  Don't kill yourself over it, though.
9/29: Here is the [Exam1Outline.pdf review outline] for the first exam.  Also, here is a [SampleExam.pdf sample] exam I gave to the equivalent of a 208 class; not helpful to study from but it gives you a sense of my "style".
9/27: The first exam will be on <b>Wednesday, October 5th</b>, and will cover chapters 2-4 in Harris.
9/16: There will be NO CLASS on Monday (the 19th).  Please read Chapter 3 of Harris and bring your questions and thoughts about the material to Wednesday's class, along with your solutions to HW4.
9/16: There was a small error in problem 3 of HW3; I forgot the 1/2.  The solutions have been corrected.
9/13: In [HW4.pdf Homework 4], problem 2a, you can drop the minus sign.
9/5: [HW3.pdf Homework 3] has now been posted.  UPDATE: The original said it was "Homework 2"; I've fixed it.
9/1: HW1 solutions are now posted.  UPDATE: I made a small correction to the answer to the last problem: the answer should be 13ns, not 20ns.
8/30: HW2 is now posted; it will be due on Wednesday due to the Labor Day holiday.  Solutions to HW1 will be available tomorrow after class.
8/30: Here are the notes on [intervals.pdf time intervals] which we will talk about in Wednesday's class; the material isn't in your textbook.
8/29: The next homework set will be posted on Tuesday, along with the solutions to HW1.
8/27: Regarding problem 1...it's a bear, isn't it?  Don't get too stuck on it that you don't do the other problems.  Here are a couple hints: <ul><li>When clock C is directly overhead of clock Y, that is an EVENT.  (The perpendicular distance between the clocks is irrelevant.) <li>At an event, the clock readings will be the same for everyone.  C and Y may show different times, but everyone will agree what times those clocks show at the event. <li>The reading on any clock is the time in the clock's frame.</ul>
8/24: There will be no quiz this first week.
8/24: The first homework assignment is now available in the Assignments tab.
8/20: Welcome to Modern Physics!  Please click on the Syllabus button above to learn more about the course.
